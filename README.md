# UnfairDieTest
A terminal C# program that will take your input of a rolled die and do the calculations to see if it is unfair.

I don't know if this will help anyone ever but I enjoyed programming this up so I thought I would throw it up here. Just run the .exe (or compile it yourself) and follow the prompts. Test those die!
